***

**Requisites**

For a successfull installation make sure to have installed the following packages.

- RFInder makes use of the most common `python` packages (e.g. `numpy`, `scipy`, `astropy`). 
- The parameter file is in `yaml` format, hence [`pyaml`](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/pyyaml), and [`json`](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/json-c) packages should be installed,
- The `logging` module is used to print out warnings.
- `.gif` file of multiple plots can be created if `ffmpeg` is installed.
- `casacore` is utilized to open casa tables.
    - install it with `python_casacore`: `pip install python-casacore` or `conda install -c conda-forge python-casacore` 
- `texmaker` to plot latex fancy formulae
- `dvipng`
- `python tk`
- RFInder class `rfinder_uzero.py` which can be used to solve the [u=0 problem](https://archive-gw-1.kat.ac.za/public/repository/10.48479/bhpj-nz95/index.html) makes use of `wsclean`, which must have been previously installed.

**Description**

This is a set of tools that have been developed in preparation of the Apertif & MeerKAT surveys.

The main function of `rfinder` is to identify the presence of RFI in an observation and visualize it according to different parameters. Two are the main functions:

- estimate the RFI present in an MS file through a sigma clipping (`rms_clip`)
- read the `FLAG` column of an MS file (`use_flags`) and summarize how RFI affects the data products of an observation. 

These are the products that `rfinder` provides and summarizes in an `.html` file:

- presence of RFI per frequency channel and baseline length.
- percentage flagged visibilities due to RFI per frequency channel. 
- increase in noice due to RFI per frequency channel.
- estimated noise per frequency channel, assuming natural weighting. 

check out the [WiKi](https://github.com/Fil8/RFInder/wiki) for a complete illustration of `RFInder`.

**Usage**

RFInder takes its variables from a default parameter file and from terminal, if any are given. 

From your current working directory typying `rfinder` this message will be shown: 

```
------ Reading default installation parameter file ------

MSNAME & telescope missing
              		please edit rfinder_default.yml in your current directory
              		or run: rfinder -i msname -fl <num> -tel <meerkat,apertif,wsrt>
              		(assuming the observation is located in your current directory)
                    

------ RFInder out ------
```

Hence, you have to set the name of the MSfile you wish to analyse. There are two ways to do this. By specifying from terminal the path to the msfile from your current directory, the field number of the source you whish to analyse, and the telescope of the observation:

```
 rfinder -i msname -fl <num> -tel <meerkat,apertif,wsrt>
```

or, editing the `rfinder_default.yml` configuration file that has been copied in your current directory (workdir, in the configuration file). 

This configuration file is read automatically by RFInder through the command `rfinder`. A short explanation of the parameters is given in the configuration file, and by typing `rfinder -h` (see below).

If you wish to use a different configuration file (at your own risk!!), type: `rfinder -c <path_to_configuration_file>`.

**Minimal instructions**

- Default `rfinder` will scan the MSfile in chunks of 10 minutes averaging 10 channels together. The output product will be an `html` file where the `gis` scan through the time steps to show the identified RFI/flags.

- Running `rfinder -noCh` after `rfinder` will produce a `full_report.html` file containing both the analysis over time steps and the analysis of the dataset as a whole.

- Running `rfinder -noCh -noMov` will analyse the full dataset as a whole and generate the `full_report.html` without embedded movies.

_Attention_: the option `rfinder -noCh` will end with a report successfully generated, only if it is run after `rfinder`. Otherwise run `rfinder -noCh -noMov`.

(These [tutorials](https://github.com/Fil8/RFInder/tree/master/tutorials) show the different capabilities of `rfinder`. **outdated**)


**Output products**

If `rfinder` runs correctly, you will find the following output products in your current directory: 

- the folder `rfi_pol` in your current directory, or in the directory specified by the `-odir` parameter (`pol` is the stokes parameters for which you analysed RFI). 
	- Within, there are the `.html` reports that you wished to generate. 
- The configuration file `rfinder_default.yml` contains the parameters of the last run.
- A `log` of the commands run by the program is stored in `log-rfinder.log`, in your working directory.

**Help**

`rfinder -h` will show you a (minimal) help:

```
